In addtion to searching for housing, user can also network with other potential interns that are looking for housing in the same area to share rent and other costs with.

## General App Attributes
- Category: Social Networking/ Hospitality/ Travel
- Mobile: The ability for a host to take picture and post them on a listing with their mobile device is an important feature. Hosts and guests will be able to communicate with each other in real time through the app.
- Story: This app was created by students for students who want to have access to all possible internship opportunites. We believe that if a student works hard enough to acquire an internship, they should have resources that allow them to pursue their goals. We want to remove limitations associated with living accomodations for students.
- Market: Two main categories of people: students with/ seeking internships who need a place to stay and the people who will be hosting the students. 
- Habit: the app wouldn't be something necessarily habit forming, as internships are longterm and are different from staying for a few days, so maybe it would be used mainly at certain times of the year, like the beginning of seasons, because it seems like thats usually when interships begin, like beginning of fall semester or spring or summer. Regardless, people will still have the option of using the networking feature to make/keep connections with those they meet. This will give them an incentive to come back or recommend the app to others causing it to gain more traffic. 
- Scope: The essential components of this app are not complex, the app needs to allow users to create profiles, post listings, search listings, and have channels of communication between users. The difficult aspect will be initially building a usable listings base so that students will have enough options to make the app useful.
